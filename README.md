# 🔥 Absolutely Insulted – Project Submission Hub

Welcome to **Absolutely Insulted** — a chaotic celebration of your summer projects, where the only thing hotter than your CPU is the **poetry roast** it’s about to receive.

This repository is a space to:

- 💻 **Showcase your summer project**
- ✍️ **Get roasted** (in rhyme)
- 🎉 **Connect, laugh, and cry with the community**

Each roast will be added as a **markdown or text file** inside the `/roasts` folder, titled with your project name.

## 📂 Roasts

Every roast will be placed in the [`/roasts`](./roasts) folder in the format:  
`roasts/your-project-title.md`

Each file will contain:
- A poetic roast of your project
- The roaster’s handle (if they wish to be known)
- Maybe… some unsolicited advice

---

## ✅ Guidelines

- **Be brave. Be respectful. Be roastable.**
- **No plagiarism or AI-only projects.**
- **Make sure your project is public or well-documented.**
- Roasts are **for fun**, not harm — keep it classy.
- Submissions close: **15th August 2025**
